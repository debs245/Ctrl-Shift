      <h4>The Common Ancestor</h4>
      <p>The last common ancestor of modern cats came from an ancient species known as Pseudaelurus that lived in Europe, Asia, and North America. Eventually modern cats evoloved from this species into eight groups.</p>

      <h4>The Pantheras</h4>
      <p>The oldest cat lineage is the Panthera lineage, also known as "the roaring cats" or the "big cats". It evolved into seven species who are found in multiple continents.</p>

      <h4>The Bay Cats</h4>
      <p>The Bay Cat lineage was next to evolve. It consists of three species that currently reside in southeast Asia.</p>

      <h4>Ice Age</h4>
      <p>An ice age occurs, creating many land bridges from frozen water, connecting many previously unreachable places.</p>

      <h4>Caracals</h4>
      <p>Ancestors of the Caracals crossed the newly formed land bridges at the Red Sea from Asia and made their homes in Africa. They later evolved into three mid-sized cat species.</p>

      <h4>Leoparduses</h4>
      <p>The ancestors of the lineage at first evolved into two species in North America. Later during a second ice age, the Panama Isthmus land bridge between North and South America. The cats moved to South America and they became the seven species that we see today.</p>

      <h4>Lynxes</h4>
      <p>The lineage evolved into the lynx species, known for short tails and tufted ears. The first two species settled in North America. Two more popped up in Eurasia from ancestors that migrated back to Asia using the  Bering Strait during the second ice age.</p>

      <h4>Pumas</h4>
      <p>Today the group has three species - the cheetah, puma (cougar) and jaguarundi. The puma and jaguarundi traveled to South America during the second ice age. The Cheetah migrated back to Eurasia and finally to Africa.</p>
